# \#HackingGreat 6 - Serverless with AWS - @Cybercom

## Tech Track 2 - Develop your Serverless Application  Locally

### Summary

Serverless applications can be developed on a laptop offline, either by running 
the code locally or running a serverless platform locally. Special interest is 
in Open Source serverless frameworks and platforms. 

The local development is also an easy way to get started without any cloud 
credentials.

More details will be added later to the GitHub repository.
