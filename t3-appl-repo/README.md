## Tech Track 3a - Applying AWS Serverless Application repository

SAR is a collection of applications ready to be deployed in serverless environment. Project templates vary from simple Hello World! -examples to complicated production ready systems. You can choose one or combine multiple projects to create your own application.

These applications utilize SAM (Simple Application Model), which is kinda like simplified CloudFormation template (it is powered by CloudFormation). The goal is to be able to spin up serverless applications fast and/or without thorough understanding of underlying components.

If this is too easy for you or you are very fast, you can try expanding your application by making your own building block. Check out track 3b!

## Tech Track 3b - Serverless By Design

- Graphical editor for designing serverless apps in AWS.
- Open source, work in progress

You van use SBD to graphically design your application template! No need to start writing JSON or YAML from the scratch. Although you propably want to make some adjustments around the template that SBD creates for you.

## Prerequisities

You are going to need access to AWS console. You can deploy templates and edit Lambda functions in browser. SAM and CF templates can be modified using any editor you like. Some people prefer using cli, in which case you are going to need AWS access keys and awscli installed and python installed.
